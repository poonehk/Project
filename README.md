# Project: Teacher Blog

## Description:
> My project is a teacher blog in which registered users can add posts related to lesson plans, math education, and lifestyle. I wanted the blog to be a community of sorts for math educators and educators in general. Users would additionally ideally be able to edit and delete their profiles. My app isn't finished yet as I would have liked for users to be able to easily view said posts as well.

## Issues:
> I particularly struggled with getting the javascript to function and link properly to my html pages. I wasn't sure if it was working because I couldn't get it connected in my terminal despite my trials. Likewise, I believe there are some issues in registering users.
